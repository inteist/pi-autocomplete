# Atomic Vault

This project has an Atomic vault — a shared knowledge store at `.vault/`.
Use the `atomic` tool to interact with it.

## Goals (Development Sessions)

Goals track your work sessions. Start one when you begin working, stop when done.

```
# Start a goal (generates a name like "swift-meadow-a3f2")
atomic vault goal start --developer "your name"

# Start with a linked intent
atomic vault goal start --intent PIMO-1

# Stop and promote (marks as completed for the team)
atomic vault goal stop --promote

# Stop and suspend (can resume later)
atomic vault goal stop

# Resume a previous goal
atomic vault goal resume swift-meadow-a3f2

# List goals
atomic vault goal list --status active
atomic vault goal list --status all
```

## Intents (JIRA-style Tasks)

Intents are units of work with auto-generated IDs (e.g., PIMO-1, PIMO-2).

**IMPORTANT: Create ONE intent per task. Check existing intents first.**

### Creating an Intent

1. **Check if the intent already exists:**
   ```
   atomic vault intent list
   ```

2. **Create exactly ONE intent** (do NOT retry if the CLI errors — check the list):
   ```
   atomic vault intent create --title "Fix authentication" --priority high
   ```
   This returns an ID like PROJ-1 and creates a scaffold file at `.vault/intents/proj-1/intent.md`.

3. **Write your plan into the intent file.** The scaffold has sections to fill in:
   ```
   edit .vault/intents/proj-1/intent.md using the .vault/templates/intent.md template
   ```
   Replace the HTML comment placeholders in each section:
   - **Description**: What's the problem? Link to the GitHub issue.
   - **Preconditions**: What must be true before starting?
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Concrete checkboxes — what does "done" look like?
   - **Files to Modify**: Table of files, what changes, and why.
   - **Approach**: Step-by-step plan referencing specific functions from the KG.
   - **Test Strategy**: How will you verify each criterion?
   - **Notes**: Findings from code exploration, trade-offs, open questions.

   The intent file IS the deliverable — a reviewer reads it to understand the full plan.

4. **Update status as you work:**
   ```
   atomic vault intent update PROJ-1 --status in-progress
   atomic vault intent update PROJ-1 --status review
   atomic vault intent update PROJ-1 --status done
   ```

### Intent Workflow Example

```
# Check existing intents first
atomic vault intent list

# Create ONE intent
atomic vault intent create --title "Add max_worker_threads option" --priority high
# → returns TOKI-1

# Explore the code to build the plan
atomic vault query search "worker_threads Builder"
atomic vault query neighbors "entity:src/runtime/builder.rs:worker_threads:42"

# Write the plan into the intent file — fill in every section
edit .vault/intents/toki-1/intent.md
# Fill in: Description, Preconditions, Acceptance Criteria,
# Files to Modify (table), Approach (steps), Test Strategy, Notes

# Link a goal and start working
atomic vault goal start --intent TOKI-1
```

Intent statuses: backlog → planned → in-progress → review → done

## Memory (Shared Knowledge)

Memory files persist project knowledge across sessions and developers.

```
# List memory files
atomic vault memory list

# Read a memory file
atomic vault memory show architecture
```

To save new knowledge, write a markdown file to `.vault/memory/` and
then run `atomic vault sync` to persist it to the database.

## Version Control (Read-Only)

The vault is tracked by the same Atomic VCS as the code. You inspect state
and history — you do **not** write to version control yourself:

```
# Check repo status
atomic status

# View change history
atomic log

# Show working copy diff
atomic diff
```

## Views and Recording Are Not Yours to Manage

You do **not** create or switch views, and you do **not** run `atomic add`,
`atomic record`, or `atomic insert` — the integration's hooks and the
workflow orchestrator own all of that:

- **Session start** puts you on the right view automatically (a forked
  draft view, a provisioned sandbox view, or a managed run's declared
  view — depending on how you were launched).
- **Turn end** records automatically with full AI provenance (model,
  session, decision graph).
- **Session end** leaves the working copy on the session's view, where
  the recorded work lives — review it there.
- **Merging into a shared view** (`atomic insert`) is a human/orchestrator
  decision made at review time — never run it yourself.

To review what the hooks recorded, use the read-only commands above
(`atomic log`, `atomic diff`).

## Workflow

1. **Check existing intents**: Don't create duplicates.
   ```
   atomic vault intent list
   ```

2. **Create ONE intent** with a clear title. Then explore the code and write a plan into the intent file:
   ```
   atomic vault intent create --title "Fix issue #42: description"
   # Explore with grep + KG queries
   # Edit .vault/intents/proj-N/intent.md with your plan
   ```

3. **Start a goal** linked to the intent:
   ```
   atomic vault goal start --intent PROJ-1
   ```

4. **Search and explore** using grep + knowledge graph together:
   ```
   grep "worker_threads" --type rs
   atomic vault query search "worker_threads Builder"
   atomic vault query neighbors "entity:src/builder.rs:worker_threads:42"
   ```

5. **Make changes** using read, edit, write tools. Recording happens
   automatically at turn end — do not run `atomic record`.

6. **Sync vault edits** after changing any vault markdown file:
   ```
   atomic vault sync
   ```

7. **Stop the goal** when done:
   ```
   atomic vault goal stop --promote
   ```

8. **Review** what was recorded (read-only):
   ```
   atomic log
   atomic diff
   ```
